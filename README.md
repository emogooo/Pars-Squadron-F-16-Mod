# Pars Squadron F-16 Mod

This project involves creating a custom mod for the game Arma 3, specifically featuring the Pars Squadron's F-16 fighter jets. Designed for personal use by myself and my friends, this mod adds detailed and realistic F-16 aircraft to the game, complete with custom liveries and squadron insignias. The mod aims to enhance the gameplay experience by providing players with high-fidelity models of the F-16, along with accurate flight dynamics, weapon systems, and avionics. This addition allows for more immersive and authentic air combat scenarios within Arma 3, reflecting the capabilities and aesthetics of the Pars Squadron.
